# Rectangle2D Class

This repository contains a Python implementation of a `Rectangle2D` class to model 2D rectangles 
and perform geometric calculations, containment checks, and comparisons.

## Features
1. **Rectangle Properties**:
   - Calculate area and perimeter.
   - Get and set rectangle dimensions and positions.

2. **Containment and Overlap**:
   - Check if one rectangle contains another or its center.
   - Determine if two rectangles overlap.

3. **Comparisons**:
   - Compare the areas of two rectangles using relational operators.
