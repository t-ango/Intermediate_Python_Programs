# Intermediate Python Programs

This repository contains a collection of intermediate-level Python projects completed during Basic Programming course at UiT 
and designed to demonstrate various programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP), 
graphical user interfaces (GUI), algorithm design and unit testing. 
Each folder represents a standalone project, complete with its own README and source files.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Bank_Account_Management_System**
- A simulation of a banking system with customer accounts, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction histories.
- Demonstrates OOP principles and encapsulation.

### 2. **Bin_Packing_Problem**
- Solves the bin-packing problem using a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of bins needed.
- Highlights algorithmic problem-solving and efficient resource allocation.

### 3. **Eight_Queens_Problem**
- Models and solves the Eight Queens problem, placing queens on an 8x8 chessboard without threatening each other.
- Demonstrates combinatorial logic and OOP.

### 4. **Find_Genes_Unit_Testing**
- Extracts valid genes from a genome string using biological constraints and tests the implementation with unit tests.
- Highlights string manipulation, algorithm refinement, and test-driven development.

### 5. **Flight_Itinerary_Management**
- Calculates total flight time and travel time for multi-flight itineraries using Python's `datetime` module.
- Showcases practical use of OOP and date-time calculations.

### 6. **GUI_Calculator**
- Implements a graphical calculator using the `tkinter` library.
- Demonstrates GUI development and interactive user interfaces.

### 7. **Geometric_Object**
- Models geometric shapes like triangles with customizable properties (e.g., color, filled state).
- Demonstrates inheritance and OOP principles.

### 8. **Lambda_Calculator**
- A simplified calculator supporting arithmetic operations with logging.
- Includes a GUI for interactivity and a backend for calculations.

### 9. **Rectangle_Class**
- A 2D rectangle class with methods for geometric calculations, containment checks, and comparisons.
- Highlights OOP and method design.

### 10. **Tic_Tac_Toe**
- A two-player grid-based game implemented in Python.
- Demonstrates logical flow, input validation, and game mechanics.

## Repository Structure
Each folder contains:
- Source code files for the project.
- A dedicated `README.md` describing the project's functionality, usage, and features.
- Unit tests (where applicable) to validate functionality.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the folder of the desired project:
   ```bash
   cd Project_Name
Follow the instructions in the project's README.md to execute the program or tests.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Additional dependencies are project-specific and listed in the respective README.md files.
